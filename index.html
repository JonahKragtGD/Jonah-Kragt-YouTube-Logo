                <h2>Design Summary</h2>
                <p>The Jonah Kragt YouTube logo is an interesting one, you may ask why there’s a III there without the third being a part of my name, or my YouTube channel's name. Well the reason being is that for a time, back when I originally started my YouTube channel in high school back in around 2015 I was REALLY into the game Civilization V. It was a hoot and a half, I would play for hours and hours, and as an impressionable kid I thought I would get into character by giving myself an ancient sounding name. So Jonius Kragtius III it was. I even went into microsoft paint to create a little icon for myself, the first time I ever remember designing anything. I was able to find a version of it through digging through some old files, but it’s heavily pixelated, best I could find.</p>

                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>Around 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was looking for a way to not go insane, while also making sure I was keeping my design skills sharp while dipping my toes back into something I had already established. For the new logo, I wanted something that looked more sleek and updated. I was thinking of some of the basic aspects of YouTube. YouTube Red was a huge thing they were advertising back in 2020, so I could not think of, see, or use YouTube without thinking about the color red. Opposite of red? Blue. (which is why my blue is more of a Cyan if you’re looking at a color wheel). </p>

                <h2>New Logo</h2>
                <p>I wanted to make a channel that was for the average person, a place you could go to sit back, relax and watch a nerdy guy crack jokes while playing his favorite games. A simplistic design with a red and blue dichotomy is really emblematic when it comes to what I accomplish with my channel. From challenge videos to casual playthroughs, it’s all there.</p>
